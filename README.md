All My Tweeters
---------------

The commit messages in this repo (on the (philipthrasher)[https://github.com/pthrasher/tweets/commits/philipthrasher] branch) are my tweets archived FOR-EVAR

I stole the idea from (@holman)[http://github.com/holman]. He's cool. Fortunately for me, I have yet to
tweet 3200 times. So I can haz all of my tweets. Yay!

He and I are using (@technoweenie)[http://github.com/technoweenie]'s (madrox)[http://github.com/technoweenie/madrox]

It's cool, enjoy.
