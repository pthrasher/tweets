The commit messages in this repo (on the philipthrasher branch) are my tweets archived FOR-EVAR

I stole the idea from @holman. He's cool. Fortunately for me, I have yet to
tweet 3200 times. So I can haz all of my tweets. Yay!

He and I are using @technoweenie's madrox (github.com/technoweenie/madrox)

It's cool, enjoy.
